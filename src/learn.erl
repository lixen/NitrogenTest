        Nitrogen uses an event-driven model built on top of Erlang pattern
        matching. Nitrogen allows you to tag elements with any Erlang term, and
        then act on the tag in server-side code when the user clicks on, hovers
        over, or otherwise interacts with the element.  Catching the event is as
        simple as writing an Erlang function.

        Nitrogen allows you to update or replace a section of your page using
        Ajax in just one line of code. Most importantly, Nitrogen lets you use
        the same consistent syntax to both build AND update the page.

        Nitrogen includes Comet support, allowing you to build interactive web
        applications that push data to the browser. By simply wrapping your
        function call in one line of code, you can turn a synchronous function
        into a long-running asynchronous function.

        "
        With Nitrogen, you can let a user interact with your application in
        complex ways.  Nitrogen lets you tag the draggable, droppable, or
        sortable elements, and then respond to the resulting events in
        server-side code as easily as you would respond to a click.

        Nitrogen includes a simple but powerful template system, allowing you
        to define a consistent style for your application. You can add headers,
        footers, and parameterized plugins to your page using a simple callout
        mechanism.

        Nitrogen leverages the power of Erlang data structures and pattern

        makes it easy to display repeated documents like blog posts or comments.

        other Nitrogen projects without having to copy-and-paste, or share them
        with the world.

        Nitrogen supports some of the most popular Erlang web servers equally:
        Mochiweb, Yaws, Cowboy, Webmachine, and Inets.  Nitrogen abstracts out
        the server specific code, meaning that you write your application on one
        http server and seamlessly transfer to a different http server without
        changing a thing.
